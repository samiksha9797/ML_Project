Startups are newly developed companies focusing on creating only one product and launching them in a market. Investors invest money in startups based on the company's potential and growth. Many kinds of research state the reasons for the success and failure of startups, which may or may not be accurate because there needs to be proper proof for the numbers given. A startup's success or failure depends on various features like the technology they use, the company's location, the position of the company amongst the other companies, etc. The company's success is when the creator of the company gets a high amount when the company becomes privately or publicly traded. In this paper,we performed a study to compare the performance of the machine-learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest,  that can predict the success or failure of a company. The evaluation metrics like accuracy, Precision, recall, F1 score, Roc-Auc score, Cohen Kappa score were used to estimate the performance of the models
.This model will be helpful for venture capitalists to invest in promising companies and also for people who are planning to establish a startup company or work for a startup can also use this model to understand the crucial features that result in the company's success.
